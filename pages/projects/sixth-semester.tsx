          During my 20-week internship internship semester I had the opportunity
          to work on the Travbyen Project, a wooden construction development. My
          focus throughout this experience was on deepening my knowledge of
          wooden constructions while actively contributing to various aspects of
          the project.

          Working closely with my mentor, I was responsible for 3D modelling
          buildings and creating detailed families for windows and doors. I also
          played a key role in solving technical challenges, such as developing
          precise sokkel details. My work extended across a range of
          architectural drawings, including elevations, site plans, sections and
          floor plans.

          Additionally, I participated in regular meetings with the project
          manager and engineers, which provided valuable insights into project
          leadershipâ€”an area I am particularly passionate about. This hands-on
          experience has significantly enhanced my skills and understanding of
          both architectural design and project management.

          On the side I have also worked in another project helping produce
          architectural drawings as the team was approaching a deadline.
